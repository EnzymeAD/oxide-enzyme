## Getting Enzyme
For convenience we offer [enzyme\_build](https://www.github.com/ZuseZ4/enzyme_build) which will take care of the following four steps:  
- cloning an appropriate Version of [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/)
- configure it acordingly to our needs, build it and add the enzyme toolchain to rustup
- downloading the latest [Enzyme](https://github.com/wsmoses/Enzyme) release
- build enzyme based on the llvm version created while compiling rust
