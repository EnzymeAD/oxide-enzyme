# Oxide-Enzyme

This is a proof-of-concept work where we are trying to integrate Enzyme (https://enzyme.mit.edu/Installation/) into Rust. Previous attempts were made at 
https://github.com/tiberiusferreira/oxide-enzyme and https://github.com/bytesnake/oxide-enzyme/

# Usage

It's super WIP at the moment, so please don't use it (especially not for any serious kind of work) It only exists as a place where we can experiment with a possible integration into the Rust ecosystem and form a base for future developments.
First you have to follow the installation instructions at (https://enzyme.mit.edu/Installation/), then with a compiled shared library of Enzyme put at a visible location (for example/usr/local/lib) you can run the example at example/ with cargo run

# Working

Not too much. But we are working on it :)
